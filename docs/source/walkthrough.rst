Walkthrough
===========

In this walkthrough, we will align a small EM stack with corgie. The example stack can be visualized through this `link <https://bit.ly/2X44Q2F>`_. 

| The example stack consists of one mask layer and one image layer. The data range of the stack is 
| Y: ``150000-200000``, Y: ``150000-200000``, Z: ``170000-17050``.
